# DataCrunchIO Rust API Client

**This is not an official implementation just a side-project to fit some personal need**

At first you should populate your env with the following variable.
You can obtain them using your account.

```bash
export CLIENT_ID="..."
export CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

Be aware there is no mocking endpoint to test the API, as far as I know.
Then the test are directly perform on production using your accont.
Use it at your own risk.
